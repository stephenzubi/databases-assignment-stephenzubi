introduction to databases
-------------------------

### background

We will create a database to house stream chemistry data (temperature,
specific conductance, dissolved oxygen) collected using data-logging
sensors called sondes. These data were collected from two different
locations on three different days using four different instruments. We
will use one table (sonde\_data) to store the sensor data, and another
(sonde\_events) to store data and metadata about each sampling event.
Note that K2\_20 is an empirically measured estimate of gas exchange
across the air-water interface that is needed for some analyses commonly
addressed with this type of data.

### create the tables

Use the SQLite import tool to create the sonde\_events table, and import
the data.

Creating the sonde\_data table is more complicated because we need to
add a FOREIGN KEY that references the sonde\_events table. The import
tool does not support creating FOREIGN KEYs so we will need to do this
with an SQL statement:

Before creating this table, change the *Foreign Keys* option in *DB
Settings* to On: (1) set to On, (2) click *change*.

    CREATE TABLE "sonde_data" (
      "id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY  AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL ,
      "sonde_event_id" INTEGER NOT NULL ,
      "Date" DATETIME,
      "Time" DATETIME,
      "Temp" DOUBLE,
      "SpCond" DOUBLE,
      "DO" DOUBLE,
      FOREIGN KEY ("sonde_event_id") REFERENCES sonde_events("id")
    );

### load data into the database

The sonde data are in two different files: *sonde\_data\_1\_3.csv* has
data for sonde events 1 through 3, and *sonde\_data\_4.csv* contains the
data for event 4. Load these data into the sonde\_data table using the
import tool in two steps. Note the empty *id* column in these files.
Unlike the sonde\_events table where we are assigning the id value used
as the primary key, here we will let SQLite populate the
auto-incrementing *id* field.

Our FOREIGN KEY references the id field in our sonde\_events table. Try
uploading *sonde\_data\_5.csv*, which is a fifth sampling event but one
that is not included in our sonde\_events table.

### getting data out of the database

We use **SELECT** statements to extract data from the tables. An
asterisk is a wild card that instructs the query to pull data from all
columns.

    SELECT * FROM sonde_data;

Or we can extract specific columns:

    SELECT Date FROM sonde_data;

Ususally we want to use certain search criteria:

    SELECT
      Date,
      DO
    FROM sonde_data 
    WHERE strftime('%m', Date) = '08' AND strftime('%d', Date) = '15';

We can group results based on data features that can be binned, this is
particularly useful for aggregate functions. The query below extracts
the minimum and maximum dissolved oxygen (DO) values for each
sonde\_event.

    SELECT
      sonde_event_id,
      MIN(DO) AS min_DO,
      MAX(DO) AS max_DO
    FROM sonde_data 
    GROUP BY sonde_event_id;

The ability to link information in our tables is a core features of
databases. We do this with **JOINs**.

For example, incorporate site\_id from the sonde\_events table into a
query of temperature and dissolved oxygen from sonde\_data:

    SELECT
      sonde_events.site_id,
      sonde_data.Temp,
      sonde_data.DO
    FROM sonde_data 
    JOIN sonde_events ON (sonde_events.id = sonde_data.sonde_event_id)
    WHERE sonde_events.id = 1;

For example, find the minimum and maximum dissolved oxgyen values for
each sonde\_event as per above but this time include the site and the
K2\_20 from the sonde\_events table:

    SELECT
      sonde_events.id,
      sonde_events.site_id,
      MIN(sonde_data.DO) AS min_DO,
      MAX(sonde_data.DO) AS max_DO,
      sonde_events.K2_20
    FROM sonde_data 
    JOIN sonde_events ON (sonde_events.id = sonde_data.sonde_event_id)
    GROUP BY sonde_events.id;

assignment
----------

Barometric pressure has a considerable influence on dissolved oxygen
concentrations in aquatic systems. We will need these data for our
analyses.

-   create a table in your database to house barometric pressure data
    corresponding to each sonde event. Note that the date and time are
    in a single column in this file, and that BP is barometric pressure.
-   populate the table with data in the atm\_pressure.csv file. The
    table should include these features:
    -   an auto-incrementing primary key
    -   an appropriate data type for each field
    -   a foreign key in which the sonde\_event\_id field of your new
        tables references the id field of the sonde\_events table
-   produce a summary table detailing the sampling site and *average*
    barometric pressue for each sonde event. See
    [here](https://www.sqlite.org/lang_aggfunc.html) for details about
    aggregating functions in SQLite.

Your submission should include the following components:

1.  in a single text file (not a Word doc, please):
    -   create table statement generating a table to house the
        barometric pressure data
    -   select statement that yields the sampling site and *average*
        barometric pressue for each sonde event

2.  the output of your select statement as a csv file

**Bonus submission:**

If you want to take it a bit further, generate a query that will produce
the minium and maximum dissolved oxygen values, and the average
barometric pressure for each sonde event. Hint: this requires a join on
a select statement. The structure looks something like this:

    SELECT
      tbl1.field1,
      tbl1.field2,
      subquery.field1
    FROM tbl1
    JOIN (
      SELECT 
        tbl2.field1,
        tbl2.field2
      FROM tbl2
      GROUP BY tbl2.groupingvar
    ) AS subquery ON (subquery.some_id = tbl1.some_id)
    GROUP BY tbl1.groupingvar;
